# Chrome Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use the Aria brand colors (gradient from #667eea to #764ba2)
- Include a recognizable symbol (document with arrow or "A" letter)
- Ensure icons are clear and visible at all sizes
- Use PNG format with transparent background

## Temporary Solution:
For development purposes, you can use any PNG files with the correct names and sizes. The extension will work with placeholder icons.

## Creating Icons:
You can create these icons using:
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators

Example prompt for AI icon generation:
"Create a modern, minimalist icon for a job resume application called 'Aria'. Use a gradient from purple (#667eea) to violet (#764ba2). Include a document or letter 'A' symbol. Clean, professional design suitable for a Chrome extension."
